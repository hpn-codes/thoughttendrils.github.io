How I acquired a cheap Linux Machine?

I wanted to do some coding work for some my personal stuff.
I have a Microsoft Surface for doing general browing. Since I wanted to use unix commands for better support,
I used WSL. While it is very good, my surface's memory was limited (I have Surface 4).
Hence, I was looking for a cheap laptop to fulfill my unix requirements. The budget I set for myself was $200.
In the past, I used to do my personal stuff like trying anything new on my office machine as they were pretty flexible for our growth. With all new cyber security measures being implemented, I decided I needed a laptop so I can do this comfortably from a coffee shop. I searched different websites. My requirement was a new Linux machine with 15in screen with 8GB RAM and some decent processor(older generation is fine). I found lot of machine starting at $500 and above and a few with $250+ too. I found as the cost went down, most brands cheap out on the RAM but market on giving more disk space. My experience with Windows has taught me that RAM is as important as a Processor (My Surface is the best example)I did not care for more disk space as most of the stuff these days are in the cloud and even external drives.

While looking at my options. Apple was out just based on my budget. Everything in the lower end are now Chromebooks or tablets. I noticed the Hardware on these cheap Chromebooks were excellent. While Chromebooks are great, they do not go much beyond the app world and is constrained by it. It works best for basic usecases and is loved by everyone who are okay to have Google as their one-stop shop and for all their needs. I wonder why can't there be Linux machines with Chromebook-like specs, after all Linux is free for everyone.

In recent times, there seem to be a small group of people interested in customizable and/or open Hardware which have support for us to modify and upgrade. This is great in our current world where everything is use and throw and none of the components are replaceable. For example, if I Google "Customization Linux Laptop", you would find brands like Framework, System76 and Pinebook. Other than Pinebook, all laptops and way more expensive for a linux machine.
Pinebook seemed to be the only option I had left. Theirs was the one for the "Reduce Digital Gap campaign" and hence the highly reduced pricing. While I wanted to get a cheaper machine, I did not want to take away a laptop meant for the campaign.Also, on reading various reviews online, the recommendation was to get the Pro as there were better chances of having defects like on screen and this was slightly out of my budget that I had earlier decided on.

Okay, now if I cannot get a Mac, Chromebook or a cheap Linux machine, the only OS left was Windows which is not directly compatible with Unix (without using WSL). I had done some coding work using WSL on my surface but I could NOT use the width and depth of hardware as is usual on Linux as my OS is already eating up most of my limited RAM and RAM is not upgradable on Surface. Hence, what I needed was a Windows laptop which fits my budget and requirements. Lower end Windows laptop is usually some combination of older generation CPU, RAM of 4GB or lesser and Windows S Operating System (for browsing and doing simple stuff at home). In today's world, it is no brainer that all hardwares support Linux. But, I did not want to leave it to chance. This can usually be confirmed using sites like Canonical which has a Ubuntu desktop Certified hardware database. Considering that I am getting a Windows machine and Canonical is the one providing the list, it was a no brainer that I needed to put Ubuntu distro, if i got a Windows machine.

During last thanksgiving, I came across Lenovo IdeaPad 1 15.6" with Intel Pentium Silver N6000, and has Windows 11 S. This had an option to do a one way migration to Windows 11. This is important as S models in Windows lock the hardware to be secure and I cannot make the machine to be a dual boot. Its cost was also well within my budget. Now I needed to verify my other requirements. From a little research, I saw that Lenovo provides machines which almost always makes sure that their system support Linux. It has a 128GN SSD which was enough (I had no plans to use it for multimedia). The big screen would be very helpful as I could have multiple windows open and can be viewed in parallel. The RAM was the only limitation as it was only 4GB. 

I decided to look at the spec sheet and saw that the motherboard can support upto 16GB of RAM. I also saw that the laptop had two RAM slots out of which one has the one slot having the 4GB ram has been soldered (which means I cannot replace this RAM with a newer and higher spec one). I highest I could put on the other was 8GB as the motherboard does not support more than 16GB of RAM. The 8GB RAM is not expensive at all and I could just order it off Amazon (and still be within my budget). 

Now,I have dual boot Windows/Linux machine, after adding the 8GB (totally 12GB), porting to Windows 11 and then installed Lubuntu, as now even Ubuntu wants higher RAM specs for background tasks. I love my system and hope to get more work done hereafter.

Please share your thoughts with me as I improve my skills and thats not limited to writing or hardware :)
